# SEAFUNCS

## SeaFuncs is a very simple query system similar to SQL made for GDPSES, if you struggle with SQL this might be easier to use for you!
- Able to get data, update data, delete data, create data and more!

# Installation
1. Go to the **latest release** and download seainstaller.php.
2. Use any FTP client! (I use firezilla for PC and mnn file explorer for mobile)
3. Select the "seainstaller.php" file then upload it to your database.
4. Run the file and done! Your link should be **https://(your db link)/seafuncs/seafuncs.php**.

I will very soon make a tutorial in YouTube and as a document, stay tuned.
