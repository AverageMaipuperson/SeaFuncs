# SEAFUNCS

## SeaFuncs is a very simple query system similar to SQL made for GDPSES, if you struggle with SQL this might be easier to use for you!
- Able to get data, update data, delete data, save variables on the database, and more!

# Installation
1. Go to the **latest release** and download the .zip file. (seafuncsinstaller.php is not available atm!)
2. Extract the contents.
3. Use any FTP client! (I use firezilla for PC and mnn file explorer for mobile)
4. Select the "seafuncs" folder then upload it to your database.
5. Done! Your link should be **https://(your db link)/seafuncs/seafuncs.php**.

I will very soon make a tutorial in YouTube and as a document, stay tuned.
